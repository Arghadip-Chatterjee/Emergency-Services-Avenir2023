# Emergency-Services-Avenir2023
We have built a Emergency Service Website where users can call for Emergency Services like Ambulance, FireTruck and ICU Ambulance. The website will show the best Route and Time and Distance Travelled also. It will also show the amount to be paid in terms of distance travelled. Finally after payment they will be able to avail service. We have also provided some Hospital Names and their Phone Numbers in the Website. There is also Login Functionality where users can Login from their respective Google Accounts. We have also used Chatsonic AI where users can interact with AI to solve thier common doubts.
